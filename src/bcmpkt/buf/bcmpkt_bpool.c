/*! \file bcmpkt_bpool.c
 *
 * BCMPKT buffer pool library is to provide simple packet buffer pool solution
 * for user to get efficiency. Each pool contains same size buffers. To create a
 * buffer pool, the user need to assign buffer size and total buffer number
 * supported in this pool.
 *
 * The user may create one buffer pool for each device, which is indexed by
 * \c unit. The \c unit = BCMPKT_BPOOL_SHARED_ID means shared buffer pool.
 *
 * BCMPKT buffer pool API supports create, destroy or cleanup buffer pool(s).
 * After a pool created, the user may alloc buffer from the pool or free an
 * allocated buffer into it.
